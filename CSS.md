1. Each component should have wrapper class with matching to the component name.  
   e.g 
   Component : `CalendarDropdown.tsx`
   wrapper className : `calendar-dropdown`
   ... rest all the css should prefix with `.cd-` for same component.

2. Width and Height, List, Pseudo (Hover, Active etc) related css can be added in respective component SCSS file.
